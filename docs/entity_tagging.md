# Chinese Entity Tagging

## Background

Entity tagging identifies pieces of text (“mentions”) and marks them with types such as Person, Organization, Geo-political Entity, Location, etc.  In addition to proper names (“Bob”), mentions may also include nominals (“the player”).

## Example

Input:

```
美国国防部长马蒂斯说，与首尔举行的名为“秃鹫”的军事演习每年春天在韩国进行，但2019年将“缩小规模”。
```

Output:

```
[美国]GPE国防部长[马蒂斯]PER说，与[首尔]GPE举行的名为“秃鹫”的军事演习每年春天在[韩国]GPE进行，但[2019年]TMP将“缩小规模”。
```

## Standard Metrics

F-score for selecting correct piece of text (“mention”) and assigning the correct type.



## <span class="t">TAC-KBP / EDL Track (2015-2017)</span>.

The NIST TAC Knowledge Base Population (KBP) Entity Discovery and Linking (EDL) track includes Chinese entity tagging for 5 types: person (PER), geo-political entity (GPE), location (LOC), organization (ORG) and facility (FAC).
* Shared task sites: [http://nlp.cs.rpi.edu/kbp/2017](http://nlp.cs.rpi.edu/kbp/2017) (likewise for 2015 and 2016)
* Shared task writeups: [http://nlp.cs.rpi.edu/paper/kbp2017.pdf](http://nlp.cs.rpi.edu/paper/kbp2017.pdf) (likewise for 2015 and 2016)
* Note that KBP-EDL 2018 includes thousands of entity types, from the YAGO ontology, but test data is provided only in English.

Data for this evaluation is available from the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC).

### Metrics

NERC F-score
* Requires identifying both text-span and type of entity mention
* 2016 and 2017 tasks includes both name and nominal mentions
* Scoring code: [http://nlp.cs.rpi.edu/kbp/2017/scoring.html](http://nlp.cs.rpi.edu/kbp/2017/scoring.html) (likewise for 2015 ad 2016)
