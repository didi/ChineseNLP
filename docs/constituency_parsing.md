# Chinese Constituency Parsing

## Background

Given a sentence, consituency parsing produces a parse tree whose internal nodes are constituents and whose leaf nodes are words.

## Example

Input:

```
柴犬是一种像精灵一样的犬种。
```

Output:

```
(IP (NP-SBJ (NN 柴犬)) (VP (VC 是) (NP-PRD (QP (CD 一) (CLP (M 种))) (DVP (IP (VP (PP (P 像) (NP (NN 精灵))) (VP (VA 一样)))) (DEV 的)) (VP (VA 犬种)))) (PU 。))
```

## Standard Metrics

* Exact match (EM): the percentage of predicted parse trees that match the ground truth exactly.
* F1 score of constituents in the predicted parse tree.
* Labeled precision (LP): precision of constituents in the predicted parse tree.
* Labeled precall (LR): recall of constituents in the predicted parse tree.


## <span class="t">Chinese Tree Bank Datasets</span>.

* Released by LDC. Requires LDC licence to acquire the datasets
* Link: [https://verbs.colorado.edu/chinese/ctb.html](https://verbs.colorado.edu/chinese/ctb.html) 
* First used for consituency parsing by [Liu and Zhang (2017)](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/Q17-1029/).
* Prior works have adopted the preprocessing in [distance-parser](https://github.com/hantek/distance-parser), which selects a subset of CTB 8.0 that corresponds to CTB 5.1.
  
| Dataset | # sentences (train)  | # sentences (dev) | # sentences (test) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CTB 5.1 | 17,544 | 352 | 348 |  
  
  
### Metrics

EM, F1, LP and LR can be calculated using the [Evalb](https://nlp.cs.nyu.edu/evalb/) tool.
